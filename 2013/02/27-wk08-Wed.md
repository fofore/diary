##using cscope, and understanding cscope and ctags
cscope and ctags are diffrent things.
when I first use cscope. I just run it in csh but there are some problems.
1.  when I find one symble and enter the file, there is no highlight.  and still not fixed now.
2.  when do one search, how to do the next: find in stack overflow: just use the TAB key.

after that, I check the google for how to use cscope and ctags to reveiw code.
1.  just use the cscope command in vim 
2.  to find symble use      :cs find xx
3.  to find calling use     :cs find c xx
4.  to find called          :cs find d xx
5.  to go to the next find  :cn
6.  to go to the prev       :cpri

cscope is diff from ctags.
they have some familier features, but different
