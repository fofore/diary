1.snipmate is really an awesome tool I have ever met,
the jobs I have done in SourceInsight are all did by snipmate, and snipmate is better than better, that makes my coding life so fun, and make my<tab> so nice.
2.another happy thing, I learn the way user vimoperator in firefox and learn to how to input int the search line 
3.I have to use map the cn and cp in quickfix to the two keys in my mouse, that way, or maybe I should keep the back and forward functions in the tool with my mouse.
