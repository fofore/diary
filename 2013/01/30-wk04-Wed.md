#TODO
1.  I need to config the vim but not the gvim, because I am always using vim but gvim. so I can use it in the console and in the bash system. not the good bash, but the bash in console with multi-tabs, that's quite good for my work.

2.  this is for change only. for test.

3.  this line is also for test.

4.  user -f to force the push action.
