to run the simulator with one command, I need to make it more easier to login.
now the telnet server can not do the automatic login
and the mini-linux does not have the ssh tool
1. find a way do the telnet login automatic in putty or in secureCRT
2. is there a better tool than putty, actually I want the terminal like in linux very much
3. install the ssh server in mini-linux
