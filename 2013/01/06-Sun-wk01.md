1.must use centos 6.3 binDVD version, the system can work
2.if want to run zebos, client and server for configuration, and run_zebos is for runing, after runing the zebos, then you can run imish for the CLI
3.make the kernel of centos 6.3 to 2.6.32.58, and after that I can compile the Zebos, and run the Zebos. 
4.in the grub/grub.conf , should input the right mapper you installed in your system. mine is /dev/mapper/vg_centos_lv_root, otherwise you will able to boot your system with new kernel.
5.the backup (snip) of virtualbox, make it easier to go back, and before this, if i make a wrong configuratihttps://raw.github.com/vgod/vimrc/master/auto-install.shon in step 4, I will have to reinstall the CentOS.
