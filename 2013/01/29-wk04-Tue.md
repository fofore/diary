##three important things
1.  can I change the format fo multimarkdown, and directly write the docs in vim, then transfer to doc or pdf, is pdf accessable?
2.  need to build up the environment as the unit test says. **this will be done in 30**
3.  install the zsh in the build server. **this can not be done, only the root user can install the zsh, every user can only config the zsh.**
