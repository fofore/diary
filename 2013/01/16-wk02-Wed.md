##the job
1.the first thing is why can't ping each other after I success runt the simulator in the centos.

**ping is not problem in mini-linux, so there must be some configuration problems. and because of the document is too old, the new one says should close the firewall, after disable all the filewall, the ping problem solved**

2.the mstpd process can't run in the mini-linux
**when use the shell script to run the mstpd process, there is nothing show, and after simple run it , it shows symbol md5 not found, after us command to find out where the symbol belong to, and copy the right lib into the right file, the problem fixed.**
